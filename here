    <h1> Eating them is an option, but so is making them </h1>
      <p> I live in California. No one else does, I wish I could say. Unfortunately, I cannot. That's why I'm thinking about boogers.</p>
    <h2> The following is a list.</h2>
       <ol>
        <li> a thing </li>
        <li> another thing </li>
        <li> a third </li>
       </ol>
       <p> There's a thing to say but I have nothing else to give. That's why it is all random. </p>
